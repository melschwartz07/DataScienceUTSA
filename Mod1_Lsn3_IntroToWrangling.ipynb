    "# Intro to Data Wrangling  \n",
    "\n",
    "Data comes in many ways, from creating your own, to harvesting from other locations.  Each end of the spectrum has it's strengths and limitations.  The strength of creating your own is that you know EXACTLY how the data was collected, what the settings were, what the assumptions were, and when it was done.  The limitation is that it is often very costly, either in time, money or both, to collect your own. You might not have either the people or the tools to get the data, especially if it's scientific data.  On the other end, harvesting data from other's work is much easier, as they've already collected it.  What you don't know is what their assumptions are, when it was done, how it was done, or what any setting were, unless they are documented (rare).  But, it is much easier for you.  What happens the majority of the time is that you find several sets of data that you want to use, all of them collected separately, with different techniques, or assumptions or data collection processes.  Now it's your job to 'merge' them together - that is *Data Wrangling*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Data wrangling requires many skills - you need to know the material, you need to be able to make decisions, and you need to be curious, among many others.  One of the technical tools we will use to analyze the data is Python.  Why use Python instead of anything else?  One of Python's strengths is that it works with incomplete data (empty data fields) well, where many don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your desired end state, you might be responsible for collecting data from other sources, such as the web or data bases.  That data was built/collected with a focus that probably doesn't target your problem.  To make the data usable for you and keep your data integrity good, you'll have to take a deep dive into how the data was collected to make sure it doesn't assume away anything you might need.  Using visualization, you will get some clues into the data, but Python provides other tools that will help you with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, you will need to standardize your data, if your standard is in kilograms, and the data you want to add is measured in ounces, you'll have to do the mathematical conversion before you consolidate into your master dataset. You'll need to determine which pieces of which datasets you're going to keep, clean them up individually, standardize them, and then merge them - THEN analyze the entire lot.  From studies, data wrangling is 60+% of your time.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Before that, let's characterize data, yet another way, but this perspective will help with programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numerical data\n",
    "__Numerical__ data also known as quantitative variable are measured in numbers to indicatetheir amount and units to indicate the quantity. Remember measurement in physics,fundamental and derived quantities. Examples include time, temperature, currency,weight. Age, Years of experience, salary, price. They are all described by numbers and units. Units must be uniform before numerical data can be compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Categorical__ data also referred to as qualitative variables refers to attributes or classeslike colours, states, size, car models, country, animal species, chemical compounds, classes of foods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical levels of measurement ##\n",
    "\n",
    "__Nominal__:  Most categorical data fall into the nominal level.  The categories are just names and classes with no progressive relationship between them.  Examples are names of cities or colors.  They are disjoint and every observation falls into one category.  Categorical data (nominal data) can be assigned numerical values and encoded as numbers for classification algorithms.  These numeric values are arbitrary and arithmetic operations or comparisons including ordering cannot be performed on the encoding numbers.  Only frequency counts can be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Ordinal__:  Ordinal levels are categorical but ordering can be performed on them. So when encodedusing numbers, progressive or consecutive numbers must be used because the ordermatters. A common example is user feedbacks; very bad, bad, indifferent, good, verygood which is usually encoded as 1 = very bad, 2 = bad, 3 = indifferent, 4 = good, 5 =very good. Another good example is educational level; less than high school, high schoolgraduate, Bachelors degree, Masters degree, Doctorate degree. This measurement isprogressive. However, we cannot tell anything about the nature of difference betweeneach category and so arithmetic operations cannot be performed since the scaledifference cannot be interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Interval__:  This level is for numerical data only, it has regular, constant intervals like a scale ornumber lines. This scale has a zero point but this zero point does not represent theabsence of that value. The values here are relative and taken with reference to a point,which is usually the zero point. Example is temperature measured in Celsius; heightmeasured with reference to sea level; date and years measured as BC and AD. For thismeasurement level, division and multiplications by each other are meaningless, onlydifferences between them are relevant. Mean, standard deviation, range and some otherstatistical analysis can be performed. Values can also be sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Ratio__:  Numerical values with absolute zeros, that is zero score represents the total absence ofthat quantity, are classified as ratio level of measurements. These values have the samecharacteristics as real numbers. Example include price, age, salary, height and weight of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers organize data into types, and work their functions based on the specific data type.  In Python pandas, the data types are known as _dtypes_.  They include:\n",
    "\n",
    "__float__ (float64) which represents decimal numbers such as 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "__int__ (int64) which represents integers such as 1\n",
    "\n",
    "__datetime__ (datetime64[ns]) is used to represent data, time and time differences\n",
    "\n",
    "__string__ (object) which includes alphabetic strings and combinations of multiple datatypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "In Module 2 and 3, we'll look at how to modify the data to standardize it, and address empty, spurious or duplicate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore a data set with lots of obvious problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's talk about the new data set, from the website Kaggle. It's a Russian real estate data from one of their premier banks. It was used in a Data Science competition to predict the price of specific apartments based on lots of parameters. It is the Russian housing dataset, from Kaggle. It has 2 sets of data, a training set and a test set, both of which are posted on BB.  This data set was broken into 2 pieces, one to train a model and a unique one to test the model.  This technique will be introduced in Module 4, but until then, we can use the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a decent size data set, 30471 rows and 292 columns.  I did post the data_dictionary.txt which describes what each column means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's look at what the sample content is.\n",
    "\n",
