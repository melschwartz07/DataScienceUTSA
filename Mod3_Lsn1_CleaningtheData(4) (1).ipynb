    "# Cleaning the Data  #\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be asking - \"I've seen LOTS of languages out there - why Python?\" - Great question.. and in this lesson you'll learn one of Python's many strengths - it works with missing data!  Many high end languages just cannot handle missing values, but Python does.  So even after you develop your high end model in another language, you might still have to work with Python to clean up your data to update your model!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sourcing ##\n",
    "Data comes 2 ways - you collect it yourself, which, in some situations, can be ideal - you know what the assumptions were made when designing the data collection, but it is also a ton of hard work, and you might not have the resources.  But you know how clean the data is.  The other way you can get data is from someone else, or multiple someones, that is, you can mine their data.  When that happens, you need to edit it to find the missing data, and then make the tough call whether to delete or edit the data.  We've already talked about the ethics of editing data - are we introducing biases?\n",
    "You will also need to edit each dataset so that the parameters are similar - if one is collected in inches and yards, and another is in centimeters and meters, you can't directly compare them without doing a conversion on one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Early on, you'll want to define some sort of data dictionary, to make sure that all your consolidated data is consistent.  In this lesson, we will find empty fields, and either delete it if too much is missing in a single record, or replace it with a mean/median.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data for this lesson ###\n",
    "First, let's talk about the new data set, from Kaggle.  It's a Russian real estate data from one of their premier banks.  It was used in a Data Science competition to predict the price of specific apartments based on lots of parameters. It has 2 sets of data, a training set and a test set, both of which are posted on Blackboard.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment ###\n",
    "Create your own Jupyter Notebook, download the data files from BB and put them in the appropriate directory, type all of the examples and exercises into it.  Run each section appropriately."
